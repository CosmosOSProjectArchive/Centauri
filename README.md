# Centauri
C# Operating System made with COSMOS
## Disclaimer
Yes, when the os boots up it shows that info thing, I added that myself when I built the devkit, why?<br>
Because I'm extra.<br>
## Information
I was bored, that's why I made this.<br>
I'll update this occasionally.<br>
## Credit
I got the idea for the logging thing from this guy:<br>
https://github.com/rxi/log.c
I didn't use his code, but use the design, so I though I'd credit him.<br>
## Todo
Fix the walmart neofetch code (its disgusting) <br>
Add scrolling.<br>
Graphical Terminal.<br>
